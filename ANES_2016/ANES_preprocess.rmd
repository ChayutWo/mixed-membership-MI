# EDA: Distribution
# V162139 (importance of reducing tax deficit) is pretty skewed as most people answered extremely important and very important
# V162140 (favor/oppose tax on millionaires) is pretty skewed as more than 60% of people answered favor
# V162149 (favor/oppose equal pay for men and women) is overwhelmed by favor response (>80%)
# V162186 (how much government regulation on business is good) is overwhelmed (~60%) by the middle response (a moderate amount) which is kind of a easy-going answer.
# V162192 (should minimum wage be raised) is dominated by raised (60%) and kept the same (30%) so the other two options are rare cases (lowered or eliminated)
# V162219 (are votes counted fairly) is dominated by an answer "most of the time" (50-60%)
# V162243 (society should make sure everyone has equal opportunity) has a pretty predictable and boring answer - most of them answered agree strongly or agree somewhat. <10% of people disagreed.
